The Brief As part of a transition year program at my local secondary school a music teacher wants to do a series of music appreciation and life skills classes where the parents of each pupil provide a playlist of their top ten songs. 

The parents name will not be revealed to the students or the music teacher so an application is needed that allows the parents to go online and enter their song list. 
The ten songs entered by each parent can be around a theme, a genre, or significant songs in their life e.g. classical music, lost love, found love, getting through bad times, best rock songs and my life events etc. 

Note from Music Teacher: 

You are trying to inspire young minds and to relay to them stories of life experiences told through music to prepare them for the life ahead of them – not about preaching but about inspiring or providing examples of real life. 
Remember how you felt at that age and look at where you are not and what has occurred in your life, your successes, failures, happy moments, sad moments. 
For the list the parent must provide a description of the list they have provided the theme etc. explaining their overall motivation of creating this list, its significance to them or its musical significance For each song there should also be a description regarding the song as to why this song is in the list reflecting back to the theme of the list. 

Each song should have at minimum the song name, artist, year published, a link to the song online – some URL that can be used to play it, the parents annotation on that song.
